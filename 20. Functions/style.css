/* color functions: hsl(x,y,z) rgb, etc */

/* image functions: radial-gradient(), linearGradient() */

/* reference function: var(--varName), url(), etc */

/* these are the css functions, we also have math functions */
/* example, 1rem = 16px, so if we set our font size to 1.5rem, we are setting it to 24px */

/* min() function takes more than 1 value and selects the one which is smallest of them all  */
/* eg:  */
/* font-size: min(2.5rem, 3vh) */
/* now our font size is dynamic, ie itll change based on the window size, so itll choose whiichever is the smallest of them both */

/* similarly we hae max() */

/* in both min and max we provide the other height as vh goo rule of thumb  */
/* and in min(), absolute bvalue is max it can get, and in max(), absolute value is the min it can get  */

/* we avoid min and max, and use clamp() */
/* clamp(min absolute value of height, relative height in vh, maximum absolute value of height) */

/* note that we can use these for other thsn height as well  */

/* we hsve filter:brightness(150%) for a:hover so it lights up on hovering */
/* we also have filter: hue-rotate(180deg); */
/* this gives a complementary color, we use it generally on a:hover  */

/* to add some text abive hovered text, we use abbr() function  */
p:hover::before {
  content: attr(data-tooltip);
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
